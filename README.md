# py-kafka
Some testing of using the python library over the usual Java library when dealing with Kafka streams.

For Windows, get a local Kafka up and running quickly by running these 2 commands in 2 separate shells:
bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties
bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties
